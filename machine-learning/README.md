## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It uses algorithms that iteratively learn from data to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.

### Key Concepts:
- **Algorithm**: A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem
- **Model**: The output of an algorithm after training on data
- **Training**: The process of teaching an algorithm using data
- **Feature**: Individual measurable properties of observed phenomena
- **Label/Target**: The correct answer that the model should predict

                         for a in self.actions])
        new_q = current_q + self.lr * (reward + self.gamma * max_next_q - current_q)
        self.q_table[(state, action)] = new_q
```

```

### 3. Data Preprocessing

# Handle missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
df_numeric = imputer.fit_transform(df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]))

# Encode categorical variables
le = LabelEncoder()
df['category_encoded'] = le.fit_transform(df['category'])

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### 4. Model Selection & Training
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Try multiple models
models = {
    'LogisticRegression': LogisticRegression(),
    'RandomForest': RandomForestClassifier(),
    'SVM': SVC(),
    'XGBoost': XGBClassifier()
}

# Cross-validation
for name, model in models.items():
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
    print(f"{name}: {scores.mean():.3f} (+/- {scores.std() * 2:.3f})")
```

### 5. Model Evaluation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score

# Train best model
best_model = RandomForestClassifier()
best_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)
y_prob = best_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Evaluate
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print(f"ROC-AUC: {roc_auc_score(y_test, y_prob):.3f}")
```

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV

# Grid Search

    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='roc_auc')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Time Series Split (for temporal data)
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
```

)

plt.plot(train_sizes, np.mean(train_scores, axis=1), label='Training Score')
plt.plot(train_sizes, np.mean(val_scores, axis=1), label='Validation Score')
plt.xlabel('Training Set Size')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.legend()
```

df['dayofweek'] = df['date'].dt.dayofweek
```

## Advanced Topics

### Ensemble Methods
Combine multiple models for better performance by leveraging the wisdom of crowds principle.

#### Voting
**Hard Voting**: Each model votes for a class, final prediction is the majority vote
**Soft Voting**: Uses predicted probabilities, averages them for final decision (generally more effective)
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

# Hard Voting
voting_clf = VotingClassifier(
    estimators=[('lr', LogisticRegression()),
                ('rf', RandomForestClassifier()),
                ('svm', SVC())],
    voting='hard'
)

# Soft Voting (uses probabilities)
voting_clf = VotingClassifier(
    estimators=[('lr', LogisticRegression()),
                ('rf', RandomForestClassifier()),
                ('svm', SVC(probability=True))],
    voting='soft'
)
```

#### Bagging
**Bootstrap Aggregating**: Trains multiple models on different random subsets of training data (with replacement), then averages predictions. Reduces variance and overfitting. Random Forest is the most popular bagging method.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier

bagging = BaggingClassifier(
    base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    n_estimators=10,
    random_state=42
)
```

#### Boosting
**Sequential Learning**: Trains models sequentially, where each new model focuses on correcting errors made by previous models. Reduces bias and can convert weak learners into strong ones. Popular variants include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier

# AdaBoost
ada_boost = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=50)

# Gradient Boosting
gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)
```

#### Stacking
**Meta-Learning**: Uses a meta-model (final estimator) to learn how to best combine predictions from multiple base models. The meta-model is trained on out-of-fold predictions from base models, creating a two-level learning architecture that often achieves superior performance.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import StackingClassifier

base_models = [
    ('rf', RandomForestClassifier()),
    ('svm', SVC(probability=True)),
    ('nb', GaussianNB())
]

stacking_clf = StackingClassifier(
    estimators=base_models,
    final_estimator=LogisticRegression(),
    cv=5
)
```

### Handling Imbalanced Data
```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler
from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight

# SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Class Weights
class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y), y=y)
model = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight='balanced')
```
