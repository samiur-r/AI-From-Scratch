# RNN, LSTM, and GRU Quick Reference

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are sequential neural network architectures designed to process data with temporal dependencies and variable-length sequences.

## What the Algorithm Does

### RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
RNNs process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that carries information from previous time steps. Each time step receives input and the previous hidden state, producing an output and updating the hidden state for the next iteration.

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTMs solve the vanishing gradient problem of traditional RNNs through a sophisticated gating mechanism. They use forget gates, input gates, and output gates to control information flow, allowing them to selectively remember or forget information over long sequences.

### GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
GRUs are a simplified version of LSTMs that combine the forget and input gates into a single update gate, and merge the cell state and hidden state. This makes them computationally more efficient while maintaining similar performance.

## When to Use It

### Problem Types
- **Sequential data modeling**: Time series forecasting, stock prices, weather data
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation
- **Speech processing**: Speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis
- **Video analysis**: Action recognition, video captioning
- **Financial modeling**: Risk assessment, algorithmic trading

### Data Characteristics
- **Sequential dependencies**: Data where order matters and past information influences future predictions
- **Variable-length sequences**: Text documents, audio clips, or time series of different lengths
- **Temporal patterns**: Data with recurring patterns or long-term dependencies

### Business Contexts
- Customer behavior prediction
- Fraud detection in transaction sequences
- Content recommendation systems
- Automated customer service (chatbots)
- Predictive maintenance using sensor data

### Comparison with Alternatives
- **Use RNN when**: Simple sequential patterns, limited computational resources, short sequences
- **Use LSTM when**: Long-term dependencies are crucial, complex temporal patterns, sufficient computational resources
- **Use GRU when**: Balance between LSTM capability and RNN efficiency, moderate sequence lengths
- **Use Transformers when**: Very long sequences, parallel processing is important, attention mechanisms are beneficial

## Strengths & Weaknesses

### RNN Strengths
- Simple architecture and easy to understand
- Memory efficient for short sequences
- Good for real-time processing
- Flexible input/output configurations

### RNN Weaknesses
- Vanishing gradient problem for long sequences
- Cannot capture long-term dependencies effectively
- Sequential processing limits parallelization
- Poor performance on complex temporal patterns

### LSTM Strengths

## Important Hyperparameters

### Architecture Parameters
- **hidden_size**: Number of units in hidden layers (64-512 common range)
- **num_layers**: Number of stacked RNN layers (1-4 typical)
- **sequence_length**: Input sequence length for training
- **bidirectional**: Whether to use bidirectional processing

### Training Parameters
- **learning_rate**: 0.001-0.01 typical range, often with decay
- **batch_size**: 32-128 common, depends on sequence length and memory
- **dropout**: 0.2-0.5 for regularization between layers
- **gradient_clipping**: 1.0-5.0 to prevent exploding gradients

### LSTM/GRU Specific
- **forget_bias**: Initial bias for forget gate (1.0 recommended for LSTM)
- **activation**: tanh (default) or other activation functions
- **recurrent_dropout**: Dropout applied to recurrent connections

## Key Assumptions

### Data Assumptions
- **Sequential order matters**: Past information influences future predictions
- **Stationarity**: Statistical properties remain relatively consistent over time
- **Sufficient sequence length**: Enough temporal context for meaningful patterns
- **Regular sampling**: Consistent time intervals between observations

### Statistical Assumptions
- **Markov property**: Future states depend on current and recent past states
- **Temporal correlation**: Adjacent time steps are more correlated than distant ones
- **Pattern persistence**: Learned temporal patterns generalize to unseen sequences

### Violations and Consequences
- **Non-stationary data**: May require preprocessing or adaptive models
- **Irregular sampling**: Needs interpolation or specialized handling
- **Very long sequences**: May hit computational or memory limits
- **Sudden pattern changes**: May require retraining or ensemble methods

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **RNN Training**: O(T × H²) per layer, where T = sequence length, H = hidden size
- **LSTM Training**: O(T × H² × 4) due to four gates
- **GRU Training**: O(T × H² × 3) due to three gates
- **Inference**: Linear in sequence length, cannot be parallelized across time steps

### Space Complexity
- **Memory usage**: O(T × H × L) for storing hidden states, where L = number of layers
- **Parameter count**: RNN < GRU < LSTM for same hidden size
- **Gradient storage**: Proportional to sequence length during backpropagation

### Scalability
- **Sequence length**: Performance degrades with very long sequences (>1000 steps)
- **Batch size**: Limited by available GPU memory
- **Model size**: Scales quadratically with hidden layer size

## Evaluation & Comparison

### Appropriate Metrics
- **Regression tasks**: MAE, MSE, RMSE for time series prediction
- **Classification**: Accuracy, F1-score, precision/recall for sequence classification
- **Generation tasks**: Perplexity, BLEU score for text generation
- **Sequence labeling**: Token-level accuracy, entity-level F1

### Cross-Validation Strategies
- **Time-based splits**: Preserve temporal order, train on past, test on future
- **Walk-forward validation**: Incremental training with expanding windows
- **Blocked cross-validation**: Non-overlapping time blocks for validation
- **Avoid random splits**: Can lead to data leakage in temporal data

### Baseline Comparisons
- **Naive models**: Last-value carry-forward, moving averages
- **Traditional ML**: ARIMA, seasonal decomposition for time series
- **Simpler architectures**: Feedforward networks, 1D CNNs
- **Modern alternatives**: Transformers, attention mechanisms

## Practical Usage Guidelines

### Implementation Tips
- **Start simple**: Begin with single-layer RNN/GRU before moving to LSTM
- **Gradient clipping**: Essential for stable training, use values around 1.0-5.0
- **Proper initialization**: Xavier/Glorot for weights, zero for biases (except forget bias)
- **Sequence padding**: Use masking for variable-length sequences

### Common Mistakes
- **Wrong data shape**: Ensure input is [batch_size, sequence_length, features]
- **Forgetting to reset states**: Clear hidden states between independent sequences
- **Improper scaling**: Normalize input features and targets appropriately
- **Ignoring vanishing gradients**: Monitor gradient norms during training

### Debugging Strategies
- **Check data flow**: Verify input/output shapes at each layer
- **Monitor gradients**: Watch for vanishing/exploding gradient problems
- **Validate on simple tasks**: Test on synthetic data with known patterns
- **Visualize hidden states**: Plot activations to understand what the model learns

### Production Considerations
- **Inference optimization**: Use stateful models for real-time prediction
- **Memory management**: Implement efficient batching for long sequences
- **Model serving**: Consider ONNX or TensorRT for deployment optimization
- **Monitoring**: Track prediction drift and temporal pattern changes

## Complete Example

Here's a comprehensive example demonstrating LSTM for time series prediction:

### Step 1: Data Preparation
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error

# What's happening: Loading and exploring a time series dataset
# Why this step: Understanding data characteristics helps choose appropriate architecture
np.random.seed(42)
# Generate synthetic time series with trend and seasonality
time = np.arange(0, 1000)
trend = 0.02 * time
seasonal = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * time / 50)
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, len(time))
data = trend + seasonal + noise

# Convert to pandas for easier manipulation
df = pd.DataFrame({'value': data, 'time': time})
print(f"Data shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Data range: {df['value'].min():.2f} to {df['value'].max():.2f}")
```

### Step 2: Preprocessing
```python
# What's happening: Scaling data and creating sequences for supervised learning
# Why this step: RNNs work better with normalized data, and we need to convert
# time series into input-output pairs with a sliding window approach

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df[['value']])

def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
    """Create sequences for supervised learning"""
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(seq_length, len(data)):
        X.append(data[i-seq_length:i, 0])
        y.append(data[i, 0])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

# What's happening: Creating 20-step input sequences to predict next value
# Why this length: Balances capturing temporal patterns vs computational efficiency
sequence_length = 20
X, y = create_sequences(scaled_data, sequence_length)

# Split data maintaining temporal order
split_idx = int(0.8 * len(X))
X_train, X_test = X[:split_idx], X[split_idx:]
y_train, y_test = y[:split_idx], y[split_idx:]

# Convert to PyTorch tensors
X_train = torch.FloatTensor(X_train).unsqueeze(-1)  # Add feature dimension
X_test = torch.FloatTensor(X_test).unsqueeze(-1)
y_train = torch.FloatTensor(y_train)
y_test = torch.FloatTensor(y_test)

print(f"Training sequences: {X_train.shape}, targets: {y_train.shape}")
```

### Step 3: Model Configuration
```python
# What's happening: Defining LSTM architecture with dropout for regularization
# Why these parameters: Hidden size of 64 provides good capacity without overfitting,
# 2 layers capture complex patterns, dropout prevents overfitting

class LSTMPredictor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=1, hidden_size=64, num_layers=2, dropout=0.2):
        super(LSTMPredictor, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers

        # LSTM layer with dropout between layers
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers,
                           dropout=dropout, batch_first=True)

        # Output layer
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        # What the algorithm is learning: The LSTM learns to selectively remember
        # and forget information across time steps using its gating mechanisms
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        # Use the last time step's output for prediction
        prediction = self.linear(lstm_out[:, -1, :])
        return prediction

# Initialize model
model = LSTMPredictor()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

print(f"Model parameters: {sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters()):,}")
```

### Step 4: Training
```python
# What's happening: Training the LSTM to minimize prediction error
# What the algorithm is learning: Patterns in the sequence that help predict
# the next value, including trend and seasonal components

def train_model(model, X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32):
    model.train()
    train_losses = []

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        epoch_loss = 0

        # Mini-batch training
        for i in range(0, len(X_train), batch_size):
            batch_X = X_train[i:i+batch_size]
            batch_y = y_train[i:i+batch_size]

            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(batch_X)
            loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), batch_y)
            loss.backward()

            # Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
            torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)

            optimizer.step()
            epoch_loss += loss.item()

        avg_loss = epoch_loss / (len(X_train) // batch_size)
        train_losses.append(avg_loss)

        if (epoch + 1) % 20 == 0:
            print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{epochs}], Loss: {avg_loss:.6f}')

    return train_losses

# Train the model
print("Training LSTM model...")
train_losses = train_model(model, X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
```

### Step 5: Evaluation
```python
# What's happening: Evaluating model performance on unseen test data
# How to interpret results: Lower MSE/MAE indicates better prediction accuracy

def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test, scaler):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        predictions = model(X_test).squeeze()

    # Convert back to original scale
    y_test_scaled = y_test.numpy().reshape(-1, 1)
    predictions_scaled = predictions.numpy().reshape(-1, 1)

    y_test_orig = scaler.inverse_transform(y_test_scaled).flatten()
    predictions_orig = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions_scaled).flatten()

    # Calculate metrics
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test_orig, predictions_orig)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test_orig, predictions_orig)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)

    # Calculate MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
    mape = np.mean(np.abs((y_test_orig - predictions_orig) / y_test_orig)) * 100

    print(f"Test MSE: {mse:.4f}")
    print(f"Test MAE: {mae:.4f}")
    print(f"Test RMSE: {rmse:.4f}")
    print(f"Test MAPE: {mape:.2f}%")

    return predictions_orig, y_test_orig

# How to interpret results:
# - MSE/RMSE: Lower values indicate better fit (in original data units)
# - MAE: Average absolute prediction error
# - MAPE: Percentage error, useful for comparing across different scales
predictions, actual = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test, scaler)
```

### Step 6: Prediction and Practical Usage
```python
# What's happening: Using the trained model for future predictions
# How to use in practice: This shows how to make predictions on new data

def predict_future(model, last_sequence, n_steps, scaler):
    """
    Predict multiple steps into the future
    """
    model.eval()
    predictions = []
    current_seq = last_sequence.clone()

    for _ in range(n_steps):
        with torch.no_grad():
            # Predict next value
            next_pred = model(current_seq.unsqueeze(0))
            predictions.append(next_pred.item())

            # Update sequence: remove first element, add prediction
            new_seq = torch.cat([current_seq[1:], next_pred.unsqueeze(0)])
            current_seq = new_seq

    # Convert back to original scale
    predictions_array = np.array(predictions).reshape(-1, 1)
    predictions_orig = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions_array).flatten()

    return predictions_orig

# Example: Predict next 10 time steps
last_sequence = X_test[-1]  # Last sequence from test set
future_predictions = predict_future(model, last_sequence, n_steps=10, scaler)

print(f"Future predictions for next 10 steps:")
for i, pred in enumerate(future_predictions, 1):
    print(f"Step {i}: {pred:.2f}")

# Practical deployment considerations:
# 1. Save the model and scaler for production use
torch.save({
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
    'scaler': scaler,
    'sequence_length': sequence_length
}, 'lstm_time_series_model.pth')

# 2. Example of loading and using the saved model
def load_and_predict(model_path, new_sequence):
    """Load saved model and make predictions on new data"""
    checkpoint = torch.load(model_path)

    # Recreate model architecture
    loaded_model = LSTMPredictor()
    loaded_model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
    loaded_scaler = checkpoint['scaler']

    # Process new sequence
    scaled_sequence = loaded_scaler.transform(new_sequence.reshape(-1, 1))
    sequence_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(scaled_sequence).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(-1)

    # Make prediction
    with torch.no_grad():
        prediction = loaded_model(sequence_tensor)
        prediction_orig = loaded_scaler.inverse_transform(prediction.numpy().reshape(-1, 1))

    return prediction_orig[0, 0]

print("\nModel saved successfully for production use!")
```
